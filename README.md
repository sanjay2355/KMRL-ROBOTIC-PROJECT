Documents, Files ,Codes Related to the project

1.randoo.py -> randomize the words and sentences in a text file.
2.extract_duration.py -> find out total duration in the database.
3.extract normal.py -> download every audio dataset from database.
4.extraction original file.py -> Most recent extraction file for downloading datasets according to the range.
                                 use requirements.txt along with the extraction original file.
                                 code:- python3 extract.py --start 0 --end 5 -f hello.json -D audios -y

                                 Open the above file in an editor and take a terminal corresponding to the location ,
                                 then paste the above code in it and run.

                                 0 in the code represents the starting index and 5 is the ending index ,  
                                 hello.json is the dataset filename and audios is the directory name in which the audios are stored.
                                 so before running the code...if needed to specify the indexes or filenames..do accordingly.
                                 Incase if we remove --end 5 from the code....it will download every audio dataset in the database
